We remember seeing Nat Friedman tweet in late 2022 that there was “not enough tinkering happening.” The LangChain open-source packages are aimed at addressing this and we see lots of tinkering happening now (Nat agrees)–people are building everything from chatbots over internal company documents to an AI dungeon master for a Dungeons and Dragons game.', metadata={'source': '/content/blog_posts/blog.langchain.dev_announcing-langsmith_.txt'}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='The blocker has now changed. While it’s easy to build a prototype of an application in ~5 lines of LangChain code, it’s still deceptively hard to take an application from prototype to production. The main issue that we see today is application performance–something that works ~30% of the time is good enough for a Twitter demo, but not nearly good enough for production.\\n\\nToday, we’re introducing LangSmith, a platform to help developers close the gap between prototype and production. It’s designed for building and iterating on products that can harness the power–and wrangle the complexity–of LLMs.\\n\\nLangSmith is now in closed beta. So if you’re looking for a robust, unified, system for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring your LLM applications, sign up here.\\n\\nHow did we get here?', metadata={'source': '/content/blog_posts/blog.langchain.dev_announcing-langsmith_.txt'}),\n",

And, in response, a set of practices and tools for debugging, testing, logging, monitoring, etc. has emerged to help developers abstract away common infrastructure and focus on what really matters - building their applications. LLM application developers deserve the same.\\n\\nLangSmith aspires to be that platform. Over the last few months, we’ve been working directly with some early design partners and testing it on our own internal workflows, and we’ve found LangSmith helps teams in 5 core ways:\\n\\nDebugging\\n\\nLangSmith gives you full visibility into model inputs and output of every step in the chain of events. This makes it easy for teams to experiment with new chains and prompt templates, and spot the source of unexpected results, errors, or latency issues. We’ll also expose latency and token usage so that you can identify which calls are causing issues.', metadata={'source': '/content/blog_posts/blog.langchain.dev_announcing-langsmith_.txt'}),\n",

We added this feature after seeing teams take logs of bad examples and copy-paste into the OpenAI playground to tweak the prompt until they got a good result. We wanted to eliminate that friction, and now with the click of a button, you can go from a log to a playground where you can actively edit. This is currently supported for both OpenAI and Anthropic models, with support for more coming soon. We’re also working on supporting this for chains in general.\\n\\nThis deep visibility into model performance has been particularly helpful for teams developing complex applications.

Most of us don't write like ChatGPT, and it can sometimes be frustratingly difficult to get the LLM to consistently respond in a particular voice (especially over longer conversations).\\n\\nWhy is this better than few-shot examples? It can be challenging to capture your voice in only a few concise snippets! Fine-tuning lets you provide a larger number of examples the model can learn from without having to see them every time you want to query the model.\\n\\nChatLoaders\\n\\nAt LangChain, we want to make it as easy as possible for you to take advantage of this improved fine-tuning support. To make it simple to adapt a model to your voice, we're adding a new integration type: ChatLoaders .\", metadata={'source': '/content/blog_posts/blog.langchain.dev_chat-loaders-finetune-a-chatmodel-in-your-voice_.txt'}),\n",

They are becoming increasingly popular in chatbot development, as they can provide more engaging and realistic conversations with users.
